Still a work in progress.

Simon Frankau did a similar work for the ZX-Spectrum version (from which the CPC version has been ported hence which is very similar).

Licence or rather lack thereof:
===============================

I do not own anything related to this game and this is some reverse-engineering of somebody else's work.
This is done as a hobby, for my own interest, as a study case.

I do not accept any responsability related to consulting or using the information in this repository.
